__air_res.py:__ program for printing the graphs for the inicial velocities of 0 through 1000. __NOTE:__ running this program will create 13 png files, so you might want to adjust it or run it in a specific folder

__air_vi_all.py:__ program for printing the plot that contains all inicial velocities.
